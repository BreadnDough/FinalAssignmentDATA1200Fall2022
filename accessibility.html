                Accessibility for us is that the webpage we are creating will be easy to use for more minority groups. 
                With our team we want to reach that as much as possible. At first we needed to get together in order to 
                talk with each other about universal design for our user, so we set a clear road for ourselves on what 
                this topic can give us. What we reached, was that our website can be easily accessible to as many user 
                of it as imaginable, regardless of their impediment, handicaps or potential hindrances in their ways. 
                Therefor, we simply mentioned several disabilities that could make the journey on our website less 
                effective with the users that have said condition(s).

                    <h2>Screenreaders</h2>
                    <p>
                        First of we started with colors. We know that there are people who are blind,
                        as sight-impaired or completely blind. There we made sure to
                        follow up by taking advantage of screen readers. We made it possible for blind 
                        people to navigate our website. Also there are people with partial or total loss
                        of function of a body part, resulting in weakness in their muscles, lack of 
                        of the basic muscle control that we take for granted. We made the website easier
                        for users by adding a &#34;skip-to-content&#34;&#45;button. This will shorten the amount
                        of times they must tabb our website. We remembered to include alt text to every 
                        image on our site. We did this for visitors that are not able to see images on
                        our website. This makes sure that we can include all users, regardless of
                        their visual ability, so they can appreciate our content.

                    <h2>Contrast checker</h2>
                    <p>
                        We focused a lot on color usage on our page. We stayed away from red and green
                        and we figured out we would choose colors like black&#44; white&#44; dark blue &#38; light blue. 
                        The nuances in blue was to create contrast with the two first mentioned
                        colors. We did contrast checks on each of the colors and tested them to make sure the test
                        at <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Contrast Checker</a> passed 
                        the test.

                    <h2>WCAG &#38; testing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Also we took quick mesaure to take use of <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML validator</a>
                        to check our <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. We found some problems such as same id being used 
                        several times. We solved this by the use of classes instead of id, so we could use the id as part of our
                        &#34;skip-to-content&#34;&#45;button and keep the code as it was, now with reusability. Unfortunately another problem that 
                        kepht repeating was the overuse of hyphens in comments, which made it not mappable to <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML 1.0</abbr>.
                        We easily solved this by reducing the hyphens &#40;&#45;&#41; to only three on the left side and two on the right side of the comment.
                        We tested our <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> with <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">CSS validator</a>.
                        It was actually really nice tool to quickly check our code! Funny enough, it was mainly just some code like: 
                        &#60;main class&#61;&#34;topical&#45;page&#34;lang&#61;&#34;en&#34;&#62;, where there were no space &#40;&#32;&#41; between lang and 
                        the quotation mark &#40;&#34;&#41;.
                    </p>

                        At last we used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (webaim.org)</a>
                        to check accessibilities on our webpages. Mainly it was two problems. The first one that we had missing labels, which was 
                        solved easily by changing the spans out with labels, and also adding the correct name to said label. Also we looked into 
                        different usage of form control for telephone, normal text and textarea. They all after changes passed the test. The second 
                        flaw seem to be with our navigation, that there was an empty form label. Because we chose to limit ourselves to not use javascript.
                        Therefor our way to create an awesome navigationbar was simply by the help of unicodes&#58; one for a hamburger together 
                        with text such as &#40;Menu&#41;, another one for &#40;Close&#41; with another unicode formed like a &#40;X&#41;. This made
                        it possible for us in our stylesheet to recreate a feasible menu. What we figured out was, that we could get through this 
                        with the design we held by the use of a space entity. This passed the test.
